    <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">Wesley Russell, FVR Biography</h1>
    <p style="color: #00FFFF; width: 50%; float: left;">I am a 17 year old kid that loves music. I have a big passion for music because it helps ease my mind.<br>
    When I am going through tough times and I can't slow down the thoughts in my head, I write it down<br>
    and make a song about it. I have gone through a lot lately and I think music is one of the main reasons<br>
    of why I am still moving forward. When I feel a certain way I turn on a song that I made about that<br>
    certain feeling, If I feel something I haven't felt before, I'll make a song about it to listen to. I don't just<br>
    make them for the heck of it, I make it to help me and the other people get through this and know that<br>
    they aren't alone in this cruel world. We all go through tough times, but we also are all strong enough<br>
    to work through it and better yourself and the others around you.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">Music Journey</h1>
    <p style="color: #00FFFF; width: 50%; float: left;">I started making music in 2024, it was one of the best
        decisions I have made. I love making music about<br>
        my life including the problems I face, the mistakes I have made. I also enjoy making up stories to write<br>
        about that gets you in the moment and some people could possibly/hopefully relate to. It is just a very<br>
        big passion of mine and I would like to continue making songs no matter how big I am, it helps me and the<br> 
        others that go through what I do. It's like a coping mechanism.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">Why Do I Use AI and How</h1>
    <p style="color: #00FFFF; width: 50%; float: left;">I use Suno to create my music. I write
    all my lyrics in google docs and type out what genre, voices, and<br> 
    instruments I would prefer in my music with the different verses. So it is still all original and all made by<br>
    me. I use AI because I don't have a good voice. I can write good lyrics but I can't sing well. So I used what<br>
    I'm good with, computers. I create and program my songs to be exactly how I want and need them to be.</p>
